The source data used is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.
Original dataset is available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Several operations was performed on the original data:
- feature vectors was combined with corresponding activity ids and subject ids in both test and training sets
- activity ids was replaced with corresponding labels in both test and training sets
- training set and test set were combined into one set
- combined data was then subsetted: only activity label, subject id and columns containing "mean()" and "std()" were selected
- the resulting set was aggregated calulating average of each variable for each activity and each subject

**The original code is located in run_analysis.R**

## The resulting set contains following variables:
- Subject
- Activity
